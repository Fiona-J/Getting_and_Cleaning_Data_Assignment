# Code Book

The dataset includes the following files:

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:   
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.   
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.   
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.  
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.   
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.  

# Steps
1. use function read.table() to read data into data set and then use function rbind() to put it together in the format of: subjects, labels, everything else;  
2. use function read.table() read the features and retain features of mean and standard deviation; select only the means and standard deviations from data and increment by 2 because data has subjects and labels in the beginning;
3. read the labels (activities) and replace labels in data with label names;
4. make a list of the current column names and feature names, then tidy that list by removing every non-alphabetic character and converting to lowercase, then use the list as column names for data;
5. use function aggregate() to find the mean for each combination of subject and labelï¼›
6. run source("run_analysis.R") , then it will generate a new file  tinydata.txt  in your working directory.
